# chess-engine-and-ui
This is an (in progress) chess engine and simple electron UI.
The UI will interface with the engine using Node.js by compiling the C++ & Python code w/ node-gyp

**To run:**  
Install node.js and electron and configure your node_modules to be in the chess_app directory.

From src/main, run cmd:  
```npx electron main.js``
