TO DO: Reformat headers and add more details to README.

This is an (in progress) chess engine and simple electron UI.
The UI will interface with the engine using Node.js by compiling the C++ & Python code w/ node-gyp

**To run:**  
Install node.js and electron and configure your node_modules to be in the chess_app directory.

From src/main, run cmd:  
```npx electron main.js```
